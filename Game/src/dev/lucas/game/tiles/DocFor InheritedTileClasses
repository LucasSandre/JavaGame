Documentation for Classes that inherit the Tile Classes

1. the Class Constructor takes in an integer and sets the Tiles Id to that integer and passes the corresponding texture to the type of tile.
2. There may be an overridden method called "IsSolid()". If so it makes the tile solid (i.e. it can not be walked threw)
